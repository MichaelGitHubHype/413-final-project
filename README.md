<h1>Bedtime Story Completion Model</h1>
<h3>CSC413 - Neural Networks & Deep Learning Final Project</h3>



## Introduction
We created two models to aid writers with creating short story.   

* A short-story generator:  A model that takes the start of a short story and continues the story. 
* A title generator: a sequence-to-sequence model that generates a title given a short story. 

The two models can be used together in a web-application to help writers overcome the writer's block and improve their speed of writing short stories.
